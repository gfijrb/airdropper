# Smart Contract Airdropper

Airdropper contract for token bounty distribution.

Parts of this implementation (`SafeMath` and `Ownable`) are taken from
[OpenZeppelin] v1.8.0, with modification to support Solidity v0.4.24.

## Why an airdropper?

As part of On-Demand Education Marketplace’s bounty and rewards campaign, the
company is obliged to transfer more than one million Tokens to thousands
of users. Transferring them one user at a time would be both tedious and
expensive.

Both of these problems can be managed by using an airdropper contract to
complete many individual transfers within one combined transaction. The
contract reduces the number of transactions and fees associated with the
distribution.

## Unique features

This airdropper differs from most others in that it never holds tokens.
Instead it calls ERC20's `transferFrom` to transfer tokens directly from a
given source address to the recipients. This has two distinct advantages:

- has already published the address which holds the tokens to be
  distributed as bounty. The recipients will see that their tokens came
  directly from this address, so they can verify that they received their
  rewards in good order.

- The contract can be tested on the main network without interfering with the
  allocation of bounty tokens, and without the need to deploy a new instance
  after testing.

This airdropper also has a method to self-destruct, which is called as soon as
tokens have been distributed to all recipients. This prevents it from being
used as an attack vector in any future zero-day exploits, and also takes some
load off the Ethereum network — it's important to be a good neighbour.
